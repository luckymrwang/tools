# Busybox - Simple Helm Chart to test Helm operations

Sometimes it is about the system rather than the chart.

Need to: Test your HELM operations? Test your CI? Test a deployment process? Verify the cluster is running? Or just do something to invoke your cluster? Busybox can help.

This chart runs a dummy process 'tail -f /dev/null' endlessly
